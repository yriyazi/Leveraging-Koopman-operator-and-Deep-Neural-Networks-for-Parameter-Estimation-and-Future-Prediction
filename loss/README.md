# Koopman Learning Code

This folder contains Python code for two stage Koopman learning using PyTorch.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Other required libraries (please refer to the `requirements.txt` file)

## Getting Started

To get started with this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/koopman-learning.git
   cd koopman-learning
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Koopman learning code by executing the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Code Overview

### Loss Calculation

The code includes a function `cacl_loss_Koopman` for calculating the Koopman loss. This function takes various parameters and performs Koopman learning. It computes the loss using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and updates the model accordingly.

## Configuration
You can configure the Koopman learning process by modifying the parameters in the `config.yaml`. Additionally, you can adjust the neural network architecture in the `config.yaml` file also.
